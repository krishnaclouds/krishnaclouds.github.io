On a seemingly inconsequential Sunday, as the afternoon light filtered through the shutters, I found myself navigating through the cobwebbed labyrinth of forgotten shelves and dusty drawers. It was in this exploration that I chanced upon an unexpected treasure: my old scribbles.

At that moment, a wave of nostalgia washed over me, reminding me of a time when writing was not merely a task to be checked off but a fervent passion that flowed effortlessly from my pen. Each page was a time capsule, unfurling stories of my past self, my companions, and a myriad of ephemeral moments. 

Among the scattered papers, I discovered meticulously handwritten notes on chemistry ⚗️, a subject that, despite its complexities, had once captivated my youthful mind. While the intricate details of textbook knowledge had long since receded into the depths of my memory, these scribbles acted as keys, unlocking the latent concepts buried within my subconscious. This serendipitous encounter with my former self ignited a spark within me.

## Why Had I Stopped?

Why had I ever ceased to write with such abandon? The question lingered, urging me to reclaim that lost enthusiasm. And so, here I am, ready to embark on this rediscovered journey. 

I would be remiss not to acknowledge the external influences that have played a pivotal role in rekindling my love for writing. The eloquent musings on [Manassaloi's blog](https://manassaloi.com/) and the thought-provoking posts on Substack have served as beacons, guiding me back to the path I once wandered with such joy and curiosity. 

Thus, I set forth, with renewed vigor and an open heart, ready to weave new narratives and explore the vast landscapes of my imagination. Let this journey commence!
