Every year, as a tradition, I create a TBR list (To Be Read). Last year, even though life took me for a ride, this list helped me come back and turn some pages here and there. Here’s last year’s list, if you’re interested — <a href="https://medium.com/@prince.balakrishna/my-tbr-for-2024-887227494e91">here</a>.

Until last year, I based my reading list on Goodreads / Reddit recommendations and added some book covers that I loved! This year, I decided to pick most of them from my bookshelf. Looking at my bookshelf, I felt overwhelmed, so I used AI to make a book list.

Gemini did a pretty decent job of preparing a TBR for me. I threw in a few books that I had previously planned (or that were missing from the shelf), and here is the final list.
